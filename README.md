# circular-boundary
At present, we provide codes for evaluating the localization performance of CBWF and Linear Boundary in the simulation scenario.

main_ simulation.m is the main function, which can provide the experimental results of CBWF and Linear Boundary, respectively.

You can also adjust the parameters in the code to obtain the positioning accuracy under different conditions

If our paper is accepted, we will open source all the code.
